    <string name="longtext">HandsFree Help Beta Version 1.0.0\n\n This app is useful for emergency situations. A speech recognizer runs on the background. This recognizer listens to you and when it hears the words \"Help Me\", the recognizer opens the emergency screen and starts vibrating for 2 seconds. So you can notice, that the recognizer has heard you. When you notice it if you aren\'t in an emergency situation, tap the \'False Alarm\' button. Since the app will dial 911 after the vibration ends. If you are in an emergency situation, wait until the second vibration. When the second vibration starts, the 911 operator will be listening to you so try to clue them in about your situation.\n\n Designed by : Agon Asani and Halid Dincher\n\n This is still a Beta version so bugs may be encountered. </string>
