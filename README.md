# ProjectForSomething
This Project For Infomatrix 2017

Beta Version 1.0.0

This app is useful for emergency situations. A speech
recognizer runs on the background. This recognizer
listens to you and when it hears the words 'Help Me', the recognizer
opens the emergency screen and starts vibrating for 2 seconds. So
you can notice, that the recognizer has heard you. When you notice it 
if you aren't in an emergency situation, tap the 'False Alarm' button.
Since the app will dial 911 after the vibration ends. If you are in an
emergency situation, wait until the second vibration. When the second
vibration starts, the 911 operator will be listening to you so try to 
clue them in about your situation.

This is still a Beta version so bugs may be encountered.
