# ProjectForSomething
This Project Made For Infomatrix 2017

Beta Version 1.1.0

This app is for emergency situations.
A speech recognizer runs on the background. This recognizer
listens to you and when it hears the words 'Help Me', the recognizer
dials 911 and tells your place. 

*This is still a Beta version so bugs may be encountered.
